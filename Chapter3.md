# Chapter 3

While the troll was furiously chasing the frightened villagers, he tripped over a rock.
Because the troll fell to the ground, he cut his knee.
His knee bled and bled, the blood ran like a river over the streets of the village.
People were drowning in the blood; it was pretty disgusting.
The troll, as he continued to bleed, uttered a single "Yuck".
