# Chapter 4

Because the troll fell to the ground he cut his knee. 
The cut was so large blood started to spill everywhere.
The troll was so sad, blood was getting all over his new crocs.
He loved those crocs. 
That day the troll learned that it was mean to chase people away from the bridge.
Even if they deserved it - those filthy tax-dodging humans.
