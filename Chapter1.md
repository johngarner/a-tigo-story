# Chapter 1

It was a Tuesday and the troll was sleeping under a bridge.
But this wasn't any ordinary bridge, but in fact the troll's bridge.
The crossing was maintained by generations of this troll's family going all the way back to his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother.
Most people think that trolls are awful creature that block humans from crossing streams and rivers, but really they just need to collect a small tax to pay for the upkeep of the bridge.
For those with not enough money, this troll even allows for humans to cross for free, only having to answer three very easy riddles.
On this fine morning, our friendly caretaker is awoken by a group of boisterous humans, rudely crossing his bridge!


This better be a conflict
