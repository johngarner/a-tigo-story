Hearing noises of the crowd, the troll woke up from the most beautiful dream he've ever had.
He was completely annoyed so the troll looks around and figures out that the noise was coming from the village.
People were having a huge celebration for the start of the fall.
He heard someone shouting like a maniac and that was the last straw. 
He sprinted acrossed the bridge, ran to the village and chased down all the villagers to stop that damn annoying partay.
