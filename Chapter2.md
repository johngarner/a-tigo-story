Hearing noises of the crowd, the troll wakes up from the most beautiful dream he've ever had.
Completely annoyed, the troll looks around and figures out that the noise was coming from the village.
People were having a huge celebration for the start of the fall.
When he heard someone shouting "Go big or go home!" like a maniac, he just couldn't stand it anymore.
He sprinted acrossed the bridge, ran to the village and chased down all the villagers to stop that damn annoying partay.
