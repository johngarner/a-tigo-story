# Chapter 2

Hearing noises of the crowd, the troll woke up from the most beautiful dream he'd ever had.
He was completely annoyed, so the troll looked around and figured out that the noise was coming from the village.
People were having a huge celebration for the start of the fall.
"Yay fall!" they exclaimed.
When the troll heard someone shouting, "Go big or go home!" like a maniac, he just couldn't stand it anymore.
He sprinted across the bridge, ran to the village, and chased down all the villagers to stop that damn annoying party.
